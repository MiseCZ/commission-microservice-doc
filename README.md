# Introduction to Commission Microservice

Commission Microservice \(CM\) helps Galileo GDS users to consistently collect commission for their reservations. It transfers responsibility for choosing the right commission rate from reservation handlers to a machine.

## Ways of using

There are three ways CM can help you with your commissions.

* Calculator - a web page for calculating the commission.
* API - a service for inserting the commission into the reservation.
* Smartpoint plugin - a tool for storing the commission into the booking file.
